Unfortunately, if you're reading this, you're probably not using JavaScript. This balance sheet is a digital replacement for the paper versions included in Robert Kiyosaki's CashFlow 101 board game. Yes, it calculates your cash flow for you, which may feel like a cheat, but I've tried it out with my family and they agree it made the game more fun (which is a littl hard to believe, I know). Try it out, you'll probably like it!</p><p>Assuming you load it up with a JavaScript-enabled modern browser, you can print this web app to re-create your paper copies. Depending on your browser, you may want to resize the window to something that looks like an 8x11 sheet of paper. After that, disable the headers and footers, adjust the margins, and print it. It should look great. If not, let me know!</p><p>This CashFlow 101 board game sheet doesn't work properly without JavaScript enabled. Please enable it to continue.</p></noscript><div id=app></div><script src=/cashflow-balance-sheet/js/chunk-vendors.71653c44.js></script><script src=/cashflow-balance-sheet/js/app.dfc38842.js></script></body></html>
