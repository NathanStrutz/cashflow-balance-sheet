## Development

What good, modern web application would be complete without an opinionated, virtual DOM powered, dynamic javascript-ecosystem-centric framework at the helm? Well not this one! Rest assured there's a framework here, and it's a great one. Vue.js is fun to use, and I definitely used it.

If you don't want this game sheet as a javascript application, check out the `html` branch, it's just plain HTML & CSS.

### Dev Setup

Install a recent version of Node and install the dependencies with this command:

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are in place, you can run it as a hot-reloading JavaScript application

```
npm run serve
```

It will open up on whatever port is the default, probably :8080.
